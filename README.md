# Code for the analysis of MHC class II DQB exon 2 sequences of Antarctic fur seals (*Arctozephalus gazella*)
___

## Overview
The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is an important group of genes that
are relevant for immunocompetence. As a result, there is still an ongoing interest
in the characterisation variation of these genes not only in relation to fitness.
With `ArGa_MHC_DQB_R`we publicly provide our analysis on the characterisation of
MHC class DQB exon 2 sequences in Antarctic fur seals. Simply download or clone
this repository and follow the steps in the `Rmarkdown` file. A pre-executed
version is provided in the document `MHC_DQB_markdown.pdf`.
